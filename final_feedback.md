Congratulations on completing your Python final project.  I hope that you got some valuable experience and knowledge from our work together this semester.  Please feel free to reach out to me any time in the future.  You can connect with me on LinkedIn and message me there any time.  I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for you.

Here's feedback on your final project, but if you'd like more detail, please reach out to me.

Nicely organized. Thank you for making it easy to read.

Around cell labeled 270, where you concatenated two data sets together, it would have been good to keep an additional column so that you could distinguish between what data source provided what data values.  With that, you could have also plotted your bar chart with each series in a different color.  That would have made the visualization easier to understand.  

Your code had good explanations, but was mostly linear.  Little use of functions that had substantial purpose and reuse.  So, while I took off a few points for modularity and coding style, I think you did a great job organizing your notebook.
