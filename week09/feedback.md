I think you're missing an understanding of the granularity of the COVID data in your last visualization, but your technical work was fine.  What you've asked Pandas to do is group by the Continent and by Total Deaths, which is merely a count of how many deaths ocurred in that Continent, in a particular region, on a particular date (it looks like to me).  So, your interpretation of that data is skewed by the total population in a particular region.  I think you'd need to do some different summarization / interpretation to draw any meaningful conclusions from that data.
